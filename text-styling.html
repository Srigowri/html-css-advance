    The Masters of Art Episode 1 | John Singer Sargent
</p>
<p class="video-description">
16,704 views &#183 Premiered on 22 Jul 2020 &#183 In this series "The Masters of Art" I will be reflecting on some of the work of my favorite artists from history. These artists have been an essential point of reference in which I have studied for the betterment my own work. I will be openly sharing my observations of what I have learned from each unique master. 
<p>
    In this video (Episode 1) we will be looking at the works of John Singer Sargent. Sargent was a master of the 19th century... He combined a unique juxtaposition of Realism and Impressionism to form some of the most iconic works of the era.

    My name is Alex Hess and I am a professional artist that focuses my craft towards Realism. I believe my paintings take a rather signature approach in the fact that very few Realism artists paint using Acrylics. If you like this content continue to join me by SUBSCRIBING to this channel.
